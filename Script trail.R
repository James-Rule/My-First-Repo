#"saving" means saving changes#

#"adding" you only have to do once, you are telling Git to watch file
#and you are telling Git what changes you have made to it#

#"commit" you are telling Git the "saved" changes you've made in
#R are changes you would like Git to recognize#

#"push"(represented by the green arrow facing upward) sends 
#everything to Github#

#aim to commit once very 20mins#

#or whenever you complete a portion of code e.g. a ggplot#

#do not commit big data##

#do not commit anything not editable i.e. PDF, PPT ect, 
#Git can't reconise these sorts of changes to the docs
#e.g. you commit a PDF, it will save a whole new ___
#this will take up lots of space on you comupter
#Git is perfect for verson control, but not in this instance

#you can tell Github to ingore things that are in Git repository
#but that you don't want on Git hub using gitignore google this lol#
